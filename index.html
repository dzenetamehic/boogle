            lets start with the boogle logo on top
            the IMG tag would fit well with a shiny id and the well known center-them class
        -->

<div class="title-logo">
    <img src="google-logo.png" width="150px">


</div>


        <!--
            I guess we have two "H"eadlines ;)
            the center-them class didn't work? how could you center your text?
         -->

<h1>One account. All of Google. </h1>

        <h2>Sign in with your Google Account</h2>

        <!--
            the next part would fit in a CONTAINER, do you agree?
            a fancy background with a nice box-shadow would be amazing...

            <!--
                the IMG and the INPUTs shouldn't be any problem for you, with the right padding and border-radius everything is fine. Everything looks better with the right box-shadow ^^
